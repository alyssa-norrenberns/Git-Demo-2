This repo is created locally and pushed to GitHub via gitbash commands.

Once in the directory of the project folder that will be added to GitHub as a repository:
- git init
- git add . (add any locally created files)
- git commit -m "Initial commit" -m "created a readme and test md file"

Need new (empty) repository on GitHub for this!
- remote add origin [link-to-empty-repo]
- git push -u origin main

Successful set up complete!
